Current status:    
    "Fake segments" instead of fit method:
        user.cpp shows how one can use a third party library, to read python serialized files for the fake functionality.
        This code is not intended for production, and a fit method shall be provided once ready.
    Resource leaking not checked, but functionality check was conducted.

How to integrate:
    The following library allows one to read ".npy" files (Numpy serialized files):
        third_party/cnpy
    Once the cnpy is compiled, the following application example can provide a reference:
        src/user.cpp 
        The application demonstrates loading "Fitted segments", storing them in a data base, as using it as demanded.
        Code for the heavy lifting of using cnpy and preparing the data for the API to use is provided in: inc/FakeSegments.h
    Data to be used by the example application: /data/testSegmentData000/*.npy In the same format as agreed upon with the primary client.

All code requires c++11 or later in order to compile.
There are no dependencies that were not provided in this package.
